###Ingredients###
serves two people

- 75gr of semolina flour
- 75gr of 00 flour *
- 1 egg
- 25gr of water (or enough to reach 75gr together with the egg)
- pinch of salt

###Method###

Put the two types of flour and salt in a bowl. Beat egg and water together in a small cup.
Slowy add the liquid to the dry ingredients little by little, while mixing with a fork. When all the ingredients are incorporated together, move onto a lightly floured surface and start kneading. Knead the dough for a few minutes and set aside covered in cling film, for at least half hour.

Cut the dough in quarters and start rolling it down till 1-2mm thick, depending on your taste, and dust with some flour if necessary. From here I usually cut it into tagliolini but it can be shaped into whatever you prefer (e.g. lasagne, fettuccine, cannelloni, ravioli). Cook in plenty of salted water - cooking times will vary depending on the thickness, start tasting after a couple of minutes

Note for me, on the Marcato machine the thickness for tagliolini is 4. Cooking time around 2 minutes and a half. 

\* The two flours can be swapped with 150gr of plain flour, the texture will be different but still fine.
