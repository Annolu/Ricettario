###Ingredients###

- 400gr of strong bread flour 
- 300ml of lukewarm water
- 8gr of salt 
- 2gr of instant yeast or 100ml of sourdough starter

###Method###

Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and the wet ones in another. If using the instant yeast, it goes with the dry ingredients, if using the sourdough starter, it goes with the water.

Tip the dry ingredients in the wet ones and mix into a rough dough with a wooden spoon. Rinse the empty bowl and oil with a couple of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.
Tip the rough dough into the oiled bowl, cover and set aside.
After about 15 minutes, fold the dough a few times - it won't look very promising at first. The dough should be folded at least a couple more times during the proofing time (folding the dough is beneficial, but not indispensable) - after each fold it should look more elastic. 

The dough with the dry yeast will rise a lot more quickly compared to the sourdough version, 3-4 hours compared to up to 8-9. The dough should get double in size at the end.

Once the dough is nice and bubbly, tip on an oven tray and spread a little, delicately. Wait a few minutes and spread again. The dough is usually pretty elastic and it can take a few rounds of spreading before the whole tray is covered. Sprinkle some water and a few spoonfulls of extra virgin olive oil on the dough. With oily fingertips, press a series of dimples all over the focaccia - ideally these should get filled with the oil. Sprinkle a generous amount of salt flakes on the surface.
Bake in the oven at 230 degrees for about 15 minutes.
