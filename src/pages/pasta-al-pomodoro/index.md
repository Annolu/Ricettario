###Ingredients###
serves two people

- half a can or about 200ml of tomato
sauce (one with only tomatoes.
It needs to be a good one *)
- 1 clove of garlic
- fresh basil (it really makes the
difference)
- freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- some chilli flakes
- extra virgin olive oil

###Method###

I usually start by boiling the water and preparing the sauce in the
mean time. Gently fry garlic and chilli in a bit of
oil in a pan for a minute and then add the
sauce. I usually add a pinch of salt and
one of sugar. Simmer for 10-15 mins, you
may need to add some cooking water of
the pasta to the sauce if it gets too
thick.

When the pasta is ready, put
basil, some pecorino, pasta and
some more oil into the pan. Stir and cook
until the cheese melts, usually about 30
seconds (this process is called 'mantecatura',
you can do it to almost any pasta and risotto dish).
Serve and sprinkle with some more
Pecorino.

I usually buy it at Ocado.
