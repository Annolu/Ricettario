###Ingredients###
serves two people

- half a can or about 200ml of tomato
sauce (one with only tomatoes.
It needs to be a good one)
- 1 clove of garlic
- fresh basil (it really makes the
difference)
- Pecorino cheese
- ome chilly flakes
- extra virgin olive oil

###Method###

I usually start boiling the water and prepare the sauce in the
mean time. Gently fry garlic and chilly in a bit of
oil in a pan for a minute and then add the
sauce. I usually add a pinch of salt and
one of sugar. Simmer for 6-7 mins, you
may need to add some cooking water of
the pasta to the sauce if it gets too
dense.

When the pasta is ready, put the
basil, some pecorino, the pasta and
some more oil into the pan. Stir and cook
until the cheese melts, usually about 30
seconds (this process is called 'mantecatura',
you can do it to almost any pasta dish).
Serve and sprinkle with some more
Pecorino.
