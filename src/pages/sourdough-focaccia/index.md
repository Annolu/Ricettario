This recipe is adapted from <span><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2019/03/22/simple-sourdough-focaccia-a-beginners-guide/" target="_blank">this</a></span> one. 

###Ingredients###

- 100gr of starter 
- 12gr of salt
- approx. 400gr of room temperature water, 
depending on the weather and humidity
- approx. 520gr of strong flour
- 30gr of olive oil + for the baking tray 

- mix of a few spoonfuls of olive oil, water and a good pinch of salt
- salt flakes

###Method###

Mix starter, water, oil and salt in a bowl. Mix in the flour and stir to combine with a fork till you have a sticky dough ball. Cover and leave to rest for a few hours, the time varies greatly depending on the temperature - it can go from 5h to 10h or more. If you want shorter times, you can speed up the process with a gram or two of dry yeast.
At the beginning, every half hour or so and for at least a couple of time, gently fold the dough in the bowl so that it takes a more stringy texture. Stop when the dough starts to rise.

When the dough has doubled in size, pour a couple of spoonfuls of olive oil onto a baking tray and tip the dough onto the tray. Start gently pulling the dough to the sides with your hands covered in oil, till the tray is covered. The focaccia should be evenly spread so that it cooks uniformly. Cover again and let it rest for at least another half hour.

Cover your fingers in oil again and start making dimples on the focaccia. Sprinkle on top the oil, water and salt emulsion and some salt flakes. 
Bake at 220 degrees for 20 minutes or until golden.
Serve on its own or with some prosciutto crudo and mozzarella.
