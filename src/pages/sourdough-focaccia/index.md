###Ingredients###

- 120gr of starter 
- 12gr of salt
- approx. 350gr of room temperature water
- approx. 500gr of strong flour
- 30gr of olive oil + for the baking tray
- 2gr of dry yeast (optional - it will speed up the process and make the dough a little less chewy)
- emultion of a few spoonfuls of olive oil, water and a good pinch of salt
- salt flakes

###Method###

Mix starter, water, oil and salt in a bowl. Mix in the flour (and yeast if using) and stir to combine with a fork till you have a sticky dough ball. The mixture will be quite wet and hydrated. Cover and leave to rest for a few hours, the time varies greatly depending on the temperature - it can go from 5h to 10h or more.
At the beginning, every half hour or so and for at least a couple of times, gently fold the dough in the bowl so that it takes a more stringy texture. Stop when the dough starts to rise.

When the dough has doubled in size, pour a couple of spoonfuls of olive oil on a baking tray and tip the dough onto the tray. Start gently pulling the dough to the sides with your finger tips covered in oil, till the tray is covered. The focaccia should be evenly spread so that it cooks uniformly. Cover again and let it rest for at least another half hour.

Cover your fingers in oil again and start making dimples on the focaccia. Sprinkle on top the oil, water and salt emulsion and some salt flakes. 
Bake at 220 degrees for at least 20 minutes or until golden. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
Serve on its own or with some prosciutto crudo and mozzarella.
