---

###Ingredients###
serves two people 

- approximately 70gr of pancetta or 120gr of salsiccia (I have only used Italian sausages for this, not sure how it would taste with different types of sausages)
- 1 small courgette
- 1 scallion or half white onion
- 1 garlic clove
- some freshly ground black pepper
- Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano cheese
- few spoonfuls of white wine 
- handful of almonds (optional)
- couple of spoonfuls of double cream (optional)

###Method###

I usually start by boiling some water and prepare the sauce in the mean time. 

Cut the courgette in small chunks and set aside.

Add a tiny bit of oil to a pan and brown the meat. Add the pepper. When the meat is ready, deglaze the pan with the wine till it's completely evaporated. Set almost all the meat aside while leaving some bits of it in the pan.

In the same pan as the meat, add the finely chopped scallion, cook for a couple of minutes and then add the courgette and garlic. 
Cook until soft. A few minutes before the pasta is ready, remove the garlic and blend the vegetables with a small chunk of cheese, almonds and cream if using and some of the water from the pot of pasta that is cooking. Blend till it becomes a smooth paste.
Incorporate meat and courgette cream and set aside.

Serve with pasta with some freshly grated cheese on top.
