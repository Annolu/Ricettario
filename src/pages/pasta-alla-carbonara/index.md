###Ingredients###

serves two people

- 2 egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- at least 120gr of guanciale (in alternative
you can use good pancetta
- at least 2-3 spoonfuls of Pecorino
Romano cheese
- a good pinch of freshly ground black
pepper
- salt
- 200gr of spaghetti
- extra virgin olive oil

###Method###

While you boil some water prepare the
egg mixture. Break and beat the eggs in a
small bowl. Add the freshly grated
cheese and some pepper, set aside.

Before adding the pasta and salt to the
boiling water start heating a pan with
some oil.
When it's hot add the meat and cook
until lightly brown. If the pasta is not
ready in the meantime, set aside the pancetta
before it gets too cooked.

Drain the pasta and add it to the pan
back on the hob and stir for a minute or
so. Set aside, pour in the egg mixture
with the pasta and stir thoroughly. If you
see that the egg it's too runny (it should
be so but I find it a bit gross, it's up to
you) you can heat it back on the hob, but
just for a few seconds cause otherwise it
cooks too much.

Serve with some more freshly grated
black pepper and Pecorino cheese.
