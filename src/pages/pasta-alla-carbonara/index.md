###Ingredients###

serves two people

- 3 egg yolks
- at least 70gr of guanciale (in alternative
you can use good pancetta)
- at least 2-3 spoonfuls of freshly grated Pecorino
Romano cheese
- a good pinch of freshly ground black
pepper
- salt
- 170gr of spaghetti
- extra virgin olive oil

###Method###

While you boil some water for the pasta prepare the
eggs mixture. Beat the egg yolks in a
small bowl. Add cheese and pepper, set aside.

Before adding pasta and salt to the
boiling water start heating a pan with
a tiny bit of oil, on medium heat.
When it's hot add the meat and cook
until lightly brown. If the pasta is not
ready in the meantime, set aside the pancetta
before it gets too crispy.

Drain the pasta and add it to the pan
back on the hob and stir for a minute or
so. Set aside, pour in the egg mixture
with the pasta and stir thoroughly. If you
see that the egg it's too runny (it should
be so but I find it a little gross, it's up to
you) you can heat it back on the hob, but
just for a few seconds because otherwise it
cooks too much.

Serve with some more freshly grated
black pepper and Pecorino cheese.
