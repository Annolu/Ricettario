###Ingredients###

- 500gr of strong bread flour
- 100gr of sourdough starter 
- 12gr of salt
- 375ml of lukewarm water

###Method###

Mix starter and water in a bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients, combine to form a rough dough, cover and set aside for about 15 minutes.
Every half hour or so and for at least a couple of times, fold the dough in the bowl so that it takes a more stringy texture.

After a few hours, shape the dough into the desired way and move to a proofing basket or bowl (I would recommend watching a youtube video about this step because it can be a little tricky - I end up improvising every time).

The proofing time varies greatly depending on the temperature - it can go from 7h to 12h or more. I usually prepare the dough around 3 in the afternoon, leave it outside till around 9 and then put it in the fridge till the following morning.

When the dough has risen enough (don't expect it to double in size, it won't be that dramatic) turn on the oven to 230c static.

Tip the dough on a sheet of oven paper and score the surface with a sharp blade (optional). That will help the loaf rise in the oven.

I usually cook the loaf in a heavy cast iron pot, if you don't have one place a bowl with some water in the oven while it's heating up and while it's cooking (optional).

If using a cast iron pot, cook with the lid on for around 30 minutes and then leave uncovered. Cook for another 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Leave to cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before eating.
