###Ingredients###

- 130gr of starter 
- 8gr of salt
- approx. 230gr of room temperature water
- approx. 400gr of strong flour
- 8gr of malt flour (optional)

###Method###

Mix starter and water in a bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients, combine and knead till the mixture gains some strength. Cover and leave to rest for a few hours.
At the beginning, every half hour or so and for at least a couple of time, fold the dough in the bowl so that it takes a more stringy texture.

After 3-4 hours shape the dough into the desired way and move to a proofing basket (I would recommend watching a youtube video about this step because it can be a little tricky - I end up improvising every time).

The proofing time varies greatly depending on the temperature - it can go from 7h to 12h or more. I usually prepare the dough around 6 in the evening, leave it outside till around 9 and then put it in the fridge till the following morning.


When the dough has risen enough (don't expect it to double in size, it won't be that dramatic) turn on the oven to 220c static. 
Tip the dough on a sheet of oven paper and score the surface with a sharp blade. That will help the loaf rising in the oven.

I usually cook bread in a dutch oven, if you don't have one place a bowl with some water in the oven while it's heating up and while it's cooking.

If using a dutch oven, cook with the lid on for around 25 minutes and then leave uncovered. Cook for another 15minutes or until golden brown.

Leave to cool on a rack for at least 1 hour before eating.
