###Ingredients###

- 80gr of basil leaves
- 50gr of Pecorino Romano cheese
- 110gr of Parmigiano cheese
- 25gr of pine nuts
- 160gr good extra virgin olive oil (it may seem a lot but it's just right)
- 1 garlic clove
- pinch of salt

###Method###

This yields quite a lot of Pesto, I usually freeze the rest in ice-cubes trays and use it later.

The traditional recipe says to use a mortar, although I have one I can't never be bothered to use it. A normal blender works just fine.

The basil leaves must be completely dry, nice and fresh and not bruised.
Blend the two cheeses and chop the garlic to a very fine paste. Set both aside.

Add all ingredients to a blender little by little. I usually start with some basil, oil and cheese and then I add the rest of the ingredients. Be careful to not over-blend, it should still have some texture and not be a completely smooth paste.
Add to some pasta and serve.

Pesto should never be heated, mix pasta and sauce in the plate or in a bowl before serving.
