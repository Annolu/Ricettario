This is my mum's recipe and the amounts are approximations.

###Ingredients###

- some tender veal meat thinly sliced, around 0.5/0.7cm thick.
I would say at least 3 medium slices per portion *
- a few Speck slices (kind of smoked prosciutto)
- semi-firm mild cheese (it should be Scamorza or Provola, 
a mild chedder should do fine)
- a couple of spoonfulls of flour
- a couple of sage leaves
- a few toothpicks 
- around 20gr of butter
- a few spoonfuls of white wine

###Method###

Lay half a slice of Speck and a small cube of cheese on a meat slice. 
Fold the meat over and roughly close it with a toothpick, repeat for all the others. Lightly flour the folded parcels. 
Add butter and sage to a large pan, when that's hot add the meat, some salt and some black pepper. Cook for a few minutes, on each side, and at the end add the wine and let evaporate completely. Serve piping hot with the preferred side.

\* Beef should be fine, they just won't be as tender.
