This is my mum's recipe and the amounts are approximations.

###Ingredients###

- some tender veal meat thinly sliced, around 0.5/0.7cm thick.
I would say at least 3 medium slices per portion *
- a few Speck slices (kind of smoked prosciutto)
- some semi-firm mild cheese (it should be Scamorza or Provola, 
a mild cheddar should do fine)
- a couple of spoonfuls of flour
- a couple of sage leaves
- a few toothpicks 
- around 20gr of butter
- a few spoonfuls of white wine

###Method###

Lay half a slice of Speck and a small cube of cheese on a meat slice. 
Fold the meat over and roughly close it with a toothpick, repeat for all the others. Lightly flour the folded parcels. 
Add butter and sage to a large pan, when that's hot add the meat, some salt and some black pepper. Cook for a few minutes, on each side, and at the end add the wine and let evaporate completely. They should look roughly like <span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saltimbocca+alla+romana&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB865GB865&sxsrf=ALeKk00UFOaioUm9esyxqz34YZe4Ph4DYw:1592924365309&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje38rXmZjqAhWCYMAKHXDsArAQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&biw=1226&bih=681" target="_blank">this</a></span> at the end.
Serve piping hot with the preferred side.

\* Beef should be fine, they just won't be as tender.
