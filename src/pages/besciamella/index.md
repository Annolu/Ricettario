This is a simpler version of the traditional recipe, it's what my mum has always used and what I use.

###Ingredients###

- 1 spoonful of flour
- 250ml of milk
- pinch of salt, black pepper and nutmeg
- 25gr of butter
- 25gr grated Parmigiano

###Method###

Put the flour in a small saucepan and add the milk little by little, till completely incorporated and without lumps. Season with the spices. 

Move on a hob on medium heat and start stirring when the milk gets warm, it will thicken after a few minutes. Move aside just before reaching boil, add butter and cheese and mix. It will thicken up further as it cools down.
