###Ingredients###
serves two people

- half a can or about 200ml of tomato
sauce (one with only tomatoes.
It needs to be a good one *)
- around 70gr of pancetta (ideally it should be guanciale)
- Pecorino cheese
- good pinch of freshly ground black pepper
- some chilly flakes or 1 fresh chilly
- pinch of salt and sugar
- extra virgin olive oil

###Method###

I usually start boiling the water and prepare the sauce in the
mean time. Gently fry the chilly in a bit of
oil in a pan for a minute and add the
meat. Cook until lightly brown, add the black pepper and then the tomato. 
Some recipes recommend to remove the meat from the pan
before adding the tomato, and it makes sense cause it would stay crispier,
but I'm lazy and I never do it.
I usually add a pinch of salt and
one of sugar. Simmer for at least 10-15 minutes, you
may need to add some cooking water of
the pasta to the sauce if it gets too
thick.

When the pasta is ready, put some pecorino, pasta and
some more oil into the pan (if you decided to remove the meat earlier,
this is the point where you would add it back). Stir and cook
until the cheese melts, usually about 15
seconds (this process is called 'mantecatura',
you can do it to almost any pasta and risotto dish).
Serve and sprinkle with some more
Pecorino.
