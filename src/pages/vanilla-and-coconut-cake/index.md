###Ingredients###

- 220gr of 00 flour (I'm sure the normal
one is fine too)
- 3 eggs
- 80gr/100gr of coconut oil
- 120ml of milk
- 180gr of sugar (the one you prefer, I
usually add a third of it in maple syrup)
- 1 vanilla pod (if you don't have a fresh
pod don't even bother with this recipe)
- about 12gr of baking powder (scant
medium spoonful)
- pinch of salt

###Method###

I usually start with the vanilla pod. I set
the seeds aside, cut the empty pod in
half lengthwise and put it in a pot with the milk.
Heat up the milk for a few mins with the
pod and then let it cool. Mix flour with
salt and baking powder and set aside.

Then beat eggs and sugar until light and
fluffy and start adding the flour a
spoonful at a time. When the batter starts
to feel dry, start adding the coconut oil,
the milk(leaving the pod out) and the
vanilla seeds at the end. And that's it.

I use a 20 something cm round
baking tin. For at least 30 mins, depending on
your oven. I use the oven on
static.
